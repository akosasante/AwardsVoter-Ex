Bruce Springsteen holds the records for the most wins and nominations, having won four awards from nine nominations. Other winners of multiple awards include Alanis Morissette as well as the bands Red Hot Chili Peppers and U2, with two. Award-winning songs have been performed by American artists more than any other nationality, though they have also been performed by musicians or groups originating from Canada, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. There have been four instances in which one artist or group was nominated for two works in the same year: the group Aerosmith was nominated for both \"Cryin'\" and \"Livin' on the Edge\" in 1994, Melissa Etheridge received nominations for \"Come to My Window\" and \"I'm the Only One\" in 1995, Jakob Dylan of The Wallflowers won for \"One Headlight\" and was also nominated for \"The Difference\" in 1998, and U2 was nominated for the songs \"Elevation\" and \"Walk On\" in 2002. Coldplay holds the record for the most nominations without a win, with four.",

Rihanna is the female artist with the most wins in the category, with five wins out of nine total nominations. John Legend has received the most nominations in the category without a win, with six. From 2017, solo recordings are no longer excluded, \"to represent the current state and future trajectory of rap by expanding the category beyond collaborations between rappers and vocalists to include recordings by a solo artist who blurs the lines between rapping and singing\".",
